Strategy pattern: Also known as policy

Defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behaviour

When to use:
- Classes only change in behavior
- Different variants of an algorithm

Benefits:
- Avoid using conditional statements
- Clients can choose the required behavior

Drawback:
- Increases number of objects
